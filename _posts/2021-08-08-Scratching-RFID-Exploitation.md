Lately, I've been thinking of learning something new - RFID exploitation is an area which I know nothing about, thought of starting off here.

Few years before I attended a security conference, where I passively heard few people talking about how they were able to unlock hotel rooms by capturing the information contained in their own room cards and manipulating the captured information - modifying the data which corresponds to each of the hotel rooms(must be changing the values contained in the room access card which matches that of the different room numbers). Keeping this in mind, just maybe there would be similar vulnerabilities like this found in the wild, provided the information that I heard regarding the exploitation is true and is not a made up boastful story.

Until now, I've went through the basics. How RFID works, the frequencies, where all possibly RFID tech can be used and such. This will be a short blog, I'll keep on updating new blogs simultaneously while I progress through. Placed an order for RFID reader/writer and RFID chip cards through an online retail store; I got the chip cards delivered, might take a while for the reader/writer to show up.
